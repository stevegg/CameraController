CameraController
================

This is a Windows IoT project written in C# to control and aggregate a set of Dlink cameras.  It uses the most excellent Restup REST service Framework written by tomkuijsten (https://github.com/tomkuijsten/restup).

Frontend is a simple set of html pages using jQuery.  This will likely change to either React or Angular (depending on how ambitious I get).
